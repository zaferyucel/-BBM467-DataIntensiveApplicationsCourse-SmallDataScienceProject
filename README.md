Jupyter Notebook of BBM467-Data Intensive Applications Course Small Data Science Project


In this project, we have built a machine learning model to predict possible diseases for a given patient. Also, we have developed a web application for our model. We have processed the given data and we have tried different classification algorithm, then we have chosen best classification algorithm by comparing accuracies of algorithms. We have used django framework for web application.
